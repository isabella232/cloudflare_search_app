# Swiftype Search

Add modern search to your site with one click! No code changes are required on your site.

The Swiftype Search App will add a "Search This Site" tab to the bottom of your website.

When clicked, the tab becomes a search overlay that will let your users find what they're looking for with fast full-text search and autocomplete. No design changes are necessary to get great search.

With Swiftype, you gain complete control over how your results are ordered and insight into what your visitors are searching for -- and the results they're finding.

**Note:** Search results will be available a few minutes after adding the app (we need to crawl your website before displaying results).

## Features

The Swiftype Search CloudFlare App is the easiest way to add search to your website, but it's powerful, too.

### Fast full-text search and autocomplete

Your visitors expect relevant results, returned quickly. Swiftype delivers, and includes modern features like type-ahead autocomplete.

### See what your users are searching for with detailed analytics

Powerful search is only half the story. With Swiftype, you can see what your users are looking for on your site and whether or not they're finding it. Search analytics make it possible to manage your user's search experience.

### Drag-and-drop to search result re-ordering

Swiftype constantly works to improve our search relevance. But ultimately, you should be in control of your search results. With Swiftype, you can perform a search, then drag and drop the results to your liking. You can also remove results, or add additional results.

### Complete control over what's indexed on your site

Swiftype allows you to control which sections of your site are indexed. Swiftype respects [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/) ([more details](https://swiftype.com/documentation/robots) and robots meta tags ([more details](https://swiftype.com/documentation/robots_meta_tag)). Additionally, you can use [path inclusions and exclusions](https://swiftype.com/documentation/path_rules) to exercise fine grained control over what parts of your site Swiftype will index.
